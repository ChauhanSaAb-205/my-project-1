Project Description: Employee Management System (Node.js CLI)

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application built using Node.js.
It allows users to manage a list of employees stored in memory (an array).

The app provides the following features:

Add Employee → User can enter an employee’s name and ID, and the employee is stored in the array.

List Employees → Displays all employees currently stored with their names and IDs.

Remove Employee → User can remove an employee by entering their ID.

Exit → Safely exits the application.

Technical Details:

Language: JavaScript (Node.js)

Modules Used: Built-in readline module (for input/output handling in terminal).

Data Storage: All employees are stored in an array during the session. No external database or files are used.

Execution: Run with node index.js in terminal.
